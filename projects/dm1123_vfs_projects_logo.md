## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a visual mark in Adobe Illustrator.

####Decide on your 4-8 letter/number combination to design a visual mark/logo mark for, that will be realized as an inspector stamp.
* It can be all letter, all numbers, or a combination of letter and numbers 
* write a few sentences describing the fictional organization, things like its name (is it an abbreviation, like NYU?), what it does, who its audience is, etc. Feel free to bring in more than one name if you're not sure.

####LOGO 1st Draft  
* Post to Slack in the "logo-project" channel
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is for to your slack channel
* Create **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black &amp; white)**
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions for a total of at least 20 images
  * A big version and a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
* at least 3 should be digital
* at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise your different versions, play around with creating <a href="http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html" target="_blank">icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos</a>

#### LOGO 2nd Draft  
* Post to Slack in the "logo-project" channel
* CHoose 3 directions from your previous 10, and create at least **5 different variations of each of the 3 directions/iterations** in color, based on each version selected in the previous class crit, for a total of at LEAST 15 versions
* One logo per letter/page (dimensions 8 1/2 x 11) for a total of at least 15 pages
* (a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)

#### LOGO Final  
* In order to come to your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version. 
* I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
* **Final logo** in color and letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11) with a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
