## SHOW & TELLS

#### LOGO SHOW & TELLS

* Pair up w/ 1 classmate

* You should find out the name of the logo designer (if you can), the dates that the logo was redesigned, and why it was redesigned.
* Cite your sources
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools)
  * Get familiar with your display preferences
* If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to **Crestron**
