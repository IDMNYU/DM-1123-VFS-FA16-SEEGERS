Exercise: Recreate an Interface

*Repetition is Learning, Repetition is Learning, Repetition is Learning…*

**Choose a digital interface that you will recreate using Adobe Illustrator**

-	Choose an interface that is complicated – the more challenging it is, the more you will learn, and the better and more capable you’ll be with Illustrator
-	Use layers and groups as needed to create depth
-	Try to match the typography exactly!
- Ideally your interface shouldn't be mainly photos, though small photos are OK, which you can represent with an 'x' placeholder box or try to draw some artwork/icon to indicate the type of image that goes there.
-	Post your Illustrator .ai file to the according slack channel
    - Make sure to outline any exotic typography (at the very end)  

**SOME HELPFUL HINTS!**
- Make sure you are in RGB color mode when you set up your file and your artboard size is the same as the real-life version.
    - Extra credit: if your interface is responsive (like a website, for example), create multiple artboards at each size, and use the elements you draw for one interface for the others
- SAVE EARLY AND OFTEN
    -It sucks to have illustrator crash and lose all your work, so save in version (i.e. “interface exercise_v1.ai,” “interface exercise_v2.ai,” or “9-20-16 Interface exercise.ai,” “9-21-16 Interface exercise.ai” etc.)
